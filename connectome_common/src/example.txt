A connectome is a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain, and may be thought of as its "wiring diagram". 
An organism's nervous system is made up of neurons which communicate through synapses. 
A connectome is constructed by tracing the neuron in a nervous system and mapping where neurons are connected through synapses.
